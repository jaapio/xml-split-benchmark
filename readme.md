This project has a number of method in php to split large xml files in to separate files containing a subset of elements.

I created this project to find the fastest way to split xml files for parallel processing. Main requirement was that
the measured method should not load all xml in to memory. Since the full file that we had to process was up to 8Gb.

This is a research project and not meant to be used in production!
